This project have the objective to develop a simulation of a gaming shop
where the user will be able to buy the products he wants through a QR Code

This project it's just the back-end, so the user will interate just with the terminal

The user will be able to choose one of the options bellow:

choice = int(input("01) Press one to see the store products \n"
                       "02) Press two to add a product in to the shopping cart \n"
                       "03) Press three to see your shopping cart \n"
                       "04) Press four to delete a product of your shopping cart \n"
                       "05) Press five to close your purchase \n"
                       "06) Press six to get out \n"
                       "-> "))

In the end, when the user decides to pay his products a png file with a QR Code contend will be genarated containing the total price of his buy

I've made this project to learn how to use this QR Code technologie!

Enjoy :D
